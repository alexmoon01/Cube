# Cube
So this is a bit of a weird experiment, but this is a project where I'm going to use the default Java graphics environment
to build a 3d cube. It's to help me understand how 3d graphics work- I'm first going to do this, then I'm going to look up how actual 3d graphics work so I can see just how much more inefficient my code is than theirs. It'll be fun. I think.
