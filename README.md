# Cube
So this is a bit of a weird experiment, but this is a project where I'm going to use the default Java graphics environment
to build a 3d cube. It's to help me understand how 3d graphics work- I'm first going to do this, then I'm going to look up how actual 3d graphics work so I can see just how much more inefficient my code is than theirs. It'll be fun. I think.

# Functionality
Because fully functional 3d graphics are something no one should ever attempt on their own, let alone a first-year college student, we're only going to have basic functionality. The program will do two things:
    1) Display a 3d cube
    2) Allow the user to click and drag the mouse and rotate the cube
    
# NOTE
I have just started a programming intensive university course, so this project is on hiatus until May 2019.
